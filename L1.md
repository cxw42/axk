# NAME

XML::Axk::Core::L1 - awk-like XML processor, language 1

# EXAMPLE

    #!axk -L1
    on { xpath(q<//item>) } run {say "$NOW: " . $E->getTagName}, CIAO
        # "CIAO" can also be "HI" or "BYE" (default BYE).
        # "leaving" is a synonym for "on" with no HI/BYE/CIAO.
    whenever { xpath(q<//item>) } run {say "$NOW: " . $E->getTagName};
        # the same as the "on ... CIAO" line
    entering { xpath(q<//item>) } run {say "$NOW: " . $E->getTagName};

# PATTERNS AND ACTIONS

- `on {<matcher>} run {<action>} [, <when>]`

    Whenever `<matcher>` says that a node matches, run `<action>`.
    The optional `<when>` parameter says when in the course of processing to
    run `<action>`:

    - `HI`

        When the node is first reached, before any of its children are processed

    - `BYE`

        After all of the node's children have been processed.  This is the default
        so that you have the text content of the node available for inspection.

    - `CIAO`

        Both `HI` and `BYE`.  Suggestions for alternative terminology are welcome.

- `entering`, `whenever` `leaving`

        entering {<matcher>} run {<action>}
        whenever {<matcher>} run {<action>}
        leaving {<matcher>} run {<action>}

    The same as `on {} run {}`, with `when` set to `HI`, `CIAO`, or `BYE`
    respectively.

- `perform { <action> } <matcher> [, <when>]`

    If you prefer RPN, or you want to save some characters, you can put the
    `<matcher>` after the `<action>` using `perform`.  For example,
    the following two lines have exactly the same effect:

        on { xpath(q<//item>) } run {say "$NOW: " . $E->getTagName}, CIAO
        perform {say "$NOW: " . $E->getTagName} xpath(q<//item>), CIAO

# VARIABLES

When an `<action>` is running, it has access to predefined variables
that hold the state of the element being matched.  This is similar to `$0`,
`$1`, ... in awk.

At present, L1 uses [XML::DOM](https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::DOM).

- **$D**

    The current XML document ([XML::DOM::Document](https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::DOM::Document))

- **$E**

    The XML element that was matched ([XML::DOM::Element](https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::DOM::Element))

- **$NOW**

    The current phase, as a human-readable string: `entering` for `HI`,
    `leaving` for `BYE`, and `both` for `CIAO`.

# MATCHERS

- `xpath('xpath expression')`

    Match nodes that match the given XPath expression.  Remember that Perl will
    interpolate `@name` in double-quotes, so single-quote or `q{}` your XPath
    expressions.

- `sel('selector')`

    Match nodes that match the given selector.

- `always`, `never`

    Always or never match, respectively.

# SPECIAL ACTIONS

- `pre_all {<block>}`

    Run `<block>` before any file is processed.

- `pre_file {<block>}`

    Run `<block>($filename)` before each file is processed.

- `post_file {<block>}`

    Run `<block>($filename)` after each file is processed.

- `post_all {<block>}`

    Run `<block>` after all files have been processed.
