=head1 NAME

XML::Axk::Bundle - namespace for plugin bundles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Axk can be extended with bundles.  A bundle may implement a new backend
or language, for example.  For ease of installation, bundles should be
distributed as CPAN distributions under the C<XML::Axk::Bundle::> namespace.
For example, a new language might be C<XML::Axk::Bundle::LangFoo>.

Names in the C<Bundle> namespace are first-come, first-served.  Authors are
requested to name language bundles starting with C<L> and backend bundles
starting with C<B>, but other than that, have fun!
